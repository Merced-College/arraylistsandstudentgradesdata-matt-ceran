# arrayListsAndStudentGradesData

This is your README.md file where you can write your reflection response for this programming project.

I completed this lab on my own since I didn't see a group discussion post on Canvas and had no way of knowing how to collaborate with my assigned group. By the time I realized what was going on I was already late so I just worked through it by myself. I learned how to read from a CSV file and store the data into an ArrayList of objects. Using printf to format the table was probably the trickiest part but it came together once I got the syntax right. Overall it was good practice with ArrayLists and file I/O.
